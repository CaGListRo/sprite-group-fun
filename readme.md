In the current state you can click on the screen an a square will appear at the mouse position and fly diagonally over the screen until it hits a wall.
After the tenth square the collision detection kicks in and the squares stop flying and start shaking. Now they only can start flying around again when you place another square on top of an "shaking" square.
